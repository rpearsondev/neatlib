System requirements

#To Do (short term)
- Finish Load/Save  -DONE
- Write CPPN Image Copyer
- Number of species in UI
- Exclude gen 1 from plots
- Write depceptive maze
- Implment ESHyperNeat
- Finish Distibuted Compute 
- GUI Extensions (camera mover etc)
- Update dependencies

# To Do (long term)
- ES Hyperneat -NOT_STSARTED
- Deceptive maze example
- Distributed Compute -DONE
- Parameterize Distributed -DONE
- Fix Tests -DONE
- Parameterize genetic modification + an other todo's -DONE
- Metric stream  -DONE
- Remove GPU -DONE
- GUI 
    - Expose load and save  -INPROG
    - species table is un-sorted (or atleast its not clear on the sorting)
    - Show activations on diagrams
    - Show biases and wights on diagrams
    - Default renderer should show something other than black
    - Rendering Bug in hyperneat when running mnist
  - Add more signals (Moving averages, so that its less bumpy)
- Algoritm
  - Color Chart of species
- Simulations:
- More examples
    - Biped locomotion  -DONE
    - CPPN image copyer -DONE
- Simulation
  - Show top species rather than top member
  - Camera mover
  - Simulation time
  - Ability to show multiple runs at once (top x species)
- Network renderer
  - Realtime view of inputs outputs (when running simulation)
  - show top 10
- Update to latest bevy
